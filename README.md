Generates a valid Screensaver file for Windows 10 (tested)/11 (untested)

<img width="659" height="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3a6dd71-ad2f-4765-aa40-3909903ff3f2" />

Whatever is happening in the Screensaver scene will be drawn while the Screensaver is active. Input of any kind kills the screensaver.

Caveats:
  - Build and Run may not work as intended due to the post build script renaming the exe

Usage:
  - Download and load the project
  - Build for Windows
  - Output Folder > Right-click .scr > Install
