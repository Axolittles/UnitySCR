Whatever is happening in the Screensaver scene will be drawn while the Screensaver is active. Input of any kind kills the screensaver.

Usage:
  - Download and load the project
  - Build for Windows
  - Output Folder > Right-click .scr > Install

Caveats:
  - Build and Run may not work as intended due to the post build script renaming the exe
  - No configuration window is generated/drawn for the Screensaver Config. The Screensaver will simply start instead.
